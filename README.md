This is a LaTeX template for the NWO VENI application form 2020 

The aim is to reproduce as much as possible the original Microsoft Word application form (science domain) that is available from the [NWO Talent Programme Veni - Science Domain](https://www.nwo.nl/en/funding/our-funding-instruments/nwo/innovational-research-incentives-scheme/veni/ew/innovational-research-incentives-scheme-veni-enw.html). Please modify relevant sections if the proposal is submitted to other domains.  

In order to use the template on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project), please set the compiler to lualatex. 

To compile the document run:
```
lualatex veni-template.tex
```
